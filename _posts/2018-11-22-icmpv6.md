## IPv6 Neighbor Discovery

NDP defines five ICMPv6 packet types: 

* 路由器请求消息 Router Solicitation (Type 133)
    Hosts inquire with Router Solicitation messages to locate routers on an attached link.[3] Routers which forward packets not addressed to them generate Router Advertisements immediately upon receipt of this message rather than at their next scheduled time.
* 路由器通告消息 Router Advertisement (Type 134)
    Routers advertise their presence together with various link and Internet parameters either periodically, or in response to a Router Solicitation message.
* 邻居请求消息 Neighbor Solicitation (Type 135)
    * IPv4 ARP requset
    Neighbor solicitations are used by nodes to determine the link layer address of a neighbor, or to verify that a neighbor is still reachable via a cached link layer address.
* 邻居通告消息 Neighbor Advertisement (Type 136)
    * IPv4 ARP response
    Neighbor advertisements are used by nodes to respond to a Neighbor Solicitation message.
* Redirect (Type 137)
    Routers may inform hosts of a better first hop router for a destination.
