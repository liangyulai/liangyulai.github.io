# How to undo your commit? 

`git revert` vs `git reset --hard`? 

`git reset HEAD` unstage files from index and reset pointer to HEAD

`git reset --soft` moves `HEAD` to specified commit reference, index and staging are untouched

`git reset --hard` unstage files AND undo any changes in the working directory since last commit

# Can you get your patch back if you done [`git reset`](http://gitref.org/basic/#reset)?

`git reset HEAD` unstage files from index and reset pointer to HEAD

Reference logs, or "reflogs", record when the tips of branches and other references were updated in the local repository.
