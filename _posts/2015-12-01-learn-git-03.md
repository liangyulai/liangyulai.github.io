# Do you know what has done if you execute "git pull"? 

[`git pull` vs `git fetch`](http://gitref.org/remotes/#fetch)

[`git fetch`](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch) download new branches and data from a remote repository

[`git pull`](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) fetch from a remote repo and try to merge into the current branch

`git pull` equals `git fetch && git merge FETCH_HEAD`

`git pull --rebase` equals `git fetch && git rebase`

# [HEAD vs FETCH_HEAD vs ORIG_HEAD](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions)

`HEAD` names the commit on which you based the changes in the working tree. 

`FETCH_HEAD` records the branch which you fetched from a remote repository with your last git fetch invocation. 

`ORIG_HEAD` is created by commands that move your `HEAD` in a drastic way, to record the position of the `HEAD` before their operation, so that you can easily change the tip of the branch back to the state before you ran them. 

`MERGE_HEAD` records the commit(s) which you are merging into your branch when you run git merge.
