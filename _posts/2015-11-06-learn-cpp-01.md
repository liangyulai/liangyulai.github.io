title:  C++ Standardization

C++ is standardized by an ISO working group known as JTC1/SC22/WG21.
So far, it has seen five versions of C++ released and is currently working on releasing C++17.

### [History of C++](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/history)

### [C++98]
  * ISO/IEC 14882:1998
  * The [C++ programming language] was initially standardized in 1998
  ``` bash
  ~$ g++ -std=c++98 hello.cc -o hello
  ```

### [C++03]
  * ISO/IEC 14882:2003
  * Final draft
  * From a programmer’s view there is none difference between C++98 and C++03.
  * The C++03 revision of the standard was a bug fix release.
  * [Gcc manual 4.3.6]
  ``` bash
  ~$ g++ -std=c++03 hello.cc -o hello
  ```

### [C++07/TR1]
  * ISO/IEC TR 19768:2007
  * Library Technical Report 1 (TR1) is the common name for ISO/IEC TR 19768, C++ Library Extensions which was a document proposing additions to the C++ standard library for the C++03 language standard.
  * The new components were defined in the `std::tr1` namespace to distinguish them from the then-current standard library.
  * Most of TR1 was available from [Boost].
  * TR1 was not a standard itself, but most of its proposals became part of the later official standard, [C++11].
  * Draft Technical Report on C++ Library Extensions [N1836].
  ``` bash
  ~$ g++ -std=c++0x hello.cc -o hello
  ```

### [C++11]
  * ISO/IEC 14882:2011
  * C++0x
  * The working draft most similar to the published C++11 standard is [N3337], dated 16 January 2012.
  * Support in GCC 4.7 and later
  * [GCC manual 4.7.4]

  ``` bash
  ~$ g++ -std=c++11 hello.cc -o hello
  ```

### [C++14]
  * ISO/IEC 14882:2014
  * Last publicly available draft [N3797]
  * November 2014 working draft [N4296]
  * Support in GCC 5.2 and later: [GCC 5 Release Series Changes](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-5/changes.html)
  * [GCC manual 5.2.0]

  ``` bash
  ~$ g++ -std=c++14 hello.cc -o hello
  ```

### GCC provides some extensions to the C++ language.

  By default, if no C++ language dialect options are given, is ‘-std=gnu++98’.

>    ~$ g++ -std=gnu++98 (extensions for c++98)
>    ~$ g++ -std=gnu++03 (extensions for c++03)
>    ~$ g++ -std=gnu++11 (extensions for c++11)

### These macros are defined by GNU compilers [GCC Common Predefined Macros]

 * `__GNUC__`
 * `__GNUC_MINOR__`
 * `__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__`

 > These macros are defined by all GNU compilers that use the C preprocessor: C, C++, Objective-C and Fortran.
 > Their values are the major version, minor version, and patch level of the compiler, as integer constants.
 > For example, GCC 3.2.1 will define `__GNUC__` to 3, `__GNUC_MINOR__` to 2, and `__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__` to 1.
