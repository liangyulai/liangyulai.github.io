# Do you have a local branch while you developing? And why?

[git branch](http://gitref.org/branching/#branch)

Branching in Git is one of its many great features. If you have used other version control systems, it's probably helpful to forget most of what you think about branches - in fact, it may be more helpful to think of them practically as contexts since that is how you will most often be using them. When you checkout different branches, you change contexts that you are working in and you can quickly context-switch back and forth between several different branches.
